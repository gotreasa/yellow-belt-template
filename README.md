# Setting up your Gitignore

As you're building up your repository you find that you need to ignore more and more files and directories as you introduce more tools and libraries that you use. To simplify updating your gitignore you can make use of website that generates the gitignore file.  One such example is - <https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore>. You should generate a gitignore file for NodeJs, SonarQube, and your operating system, and save the contents to your `.gitignore` file.
